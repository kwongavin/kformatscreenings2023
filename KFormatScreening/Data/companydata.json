If you're a fan, perform with your star. Each performing with as many as 300 of their biggest fans, 8 famous musical artists go head-to-head to win a grand prize in the finals. The fans practice by themselves based on a prep guide sent by the artist until show time, when they perform with their idol for the first time ever. The artist doesn't know how many of the 300 fans have shown up and how ready they are. But together, they have only one shot to tear up the stage. No rehearsal. No do-over. The performance is not just a sing-along. It's a choreographed spectacle with explosive singing, synchronized dancing and the added flair of coordinated outfits and props. The winner is determined by not only audience and judge votes, but also the fan attendance rate. Will all 300 fans show up for their artist? Whose fans will win and share the cash prize? A super star with 300 super fans, united as one. 300.",
